# Real-vs-edited
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to differentiate between real and edited images.
The primary objective is to detect tampered images by leveraging the CASIA dataset, which consists of both authentic and manipulated images. 
With the increasing availability of image editing tools, distinguishing between original and edited images is a significant challenge in fields like digital forensics and content verification.
Dataset: CASIA
The CASIA dataset is widely used for image forgery detection research. It includes two main categories of images:
Authentic (Real) Images: These images are untouched, reflecting the original content.
Tampered (Edited) Images: These images have been manipulated, either through splicing, copy-move, or other editing techniques.
